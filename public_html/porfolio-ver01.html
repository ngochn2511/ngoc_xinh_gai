                                        <p><strong>The context:</strong><br>
                                            By the end of 2020, I've chosen to change jobs. Despite the fact that the
                                            covid epidemic is spreading, I'm seeing an increase in people investing in
                                            the stock and financial markets. As a result, I accepted the employment offer from the Stock company in early 2021.
                                            I started researching and building Entrade X - Underlying Securities Web Platform in March 2021.<br><br>

                                        Because the trading application has already been developed and implemented.
                                        Our Product Owner's idea is to build two platforms that cater to two distinct
                                        groups of individuals. Brokers have priority on the Web, while retail users have
                                        priority on the App.<br><br>
                                        The trading site's purpose is to improve the high-value transaction trading
                                        experience. In 2021, it will also increase revenue by boosting the number of new
                                        users who make at least one purchase on the site. The first release is scheduled
                                        for July 2021. It was tested by 10 to 20 internal users, the majority of whom
                                        are brokers.</p>

                                                    <strong>Freemium</strong> - With brokers, we offer more powerful consulting services.

                                            <p><h4>Working process with devs</h4></p>
                                            <p>Initially, the corporation did not divide its employees into tiny groups. On a single App project, people collaborated in a large group. Since my arrival, we've formed a new web team. However, the developers have no concept of how to communicate effectively between the designer and the BA. We had disagreements over altering the designs, a mismatch with the BA's demand, and the designer's failure to communicate the ideas to the developers.
                                            <br><br>
                                            By getting the information in team group chat, all those involved in the implementation of the designs (devs, BA, etc) can be part of a smooth hand-off process.By getting the information in team group chat, all those involved in the implementation of the designs (devs, BA, etc) can be part of a smooth hand-off process.
                                            Each team member is focused on their tasks instead of spending time to find the necessary specs (want & need), therefore reducing the overall back-and-forths within the implementation process.
                                            <br><br>
                                            I requested that the devs and BA not use the chat channel to connect to me privately. We should use Jira and Zeplin to make comments so that everyone on the team understands what's going on. Furthermore, I make an effort to engage with team members more frequently via group chat, which is the quickest and easiest way to contact them.

                                        <p><h4>Internal Test</h4></p>
                                        <p>I conducted UI and functional testing with early adopter users, who are brokers, in the first phase. They were using the trading web MVP version, which had only the most basic functions. Login, logout, alter dark/light theme, track watchlist, deal book, portfolio, and buy/sell tickers are just a few examples.</p>
                                        <p>I gathered user perceptions and expectations, as well as the challenges they face in the actual world. I realized that the development team's thinking and end-user behaviour were vastly different. As a result, while new features are being developed, I've chosen to ask and listen to users more. Taking notes and organizing them in one space, such as the Notion platform, is also a fantastic idea. It makes it easier for me to keep track of and access the information when I need it.</p>

                                            <p>Since I joined the company, I was directly assigned to build the trading website. My CEO told me that he thinks I'll do fantastic at it. Together with me, he wants to learn about product design and customer experience. Over ten years of finance experience, he worked with a variety of domestic and international trading products. The CEO agreed that great products aren't just about how many features they offer; they're also about how satisfied customers learn and grow as a result of using the product.</p>
                                            <p>When my design was mentioned in the first demo, the internal members were excited. They noticed that the former website version's details, flow, and features were all organized differently. That's how UX plays a vital role in developing the product.</p>
                                            <p>Every day, our customer support team collects feedback from customers via several sources (FB, Zalo, Mail, Telegram). They informed the Web team that the feedback had been positive. Customers are immediately fascinated with the new web trading version.</p>
